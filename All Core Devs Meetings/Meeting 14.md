# All Core Devs: Meeting 14
## Time: 4/21/2017 14:00PM UTC
## [Audio/Video of Meeting](https://youtu.be/PGi0vBxDPHY)

### Agenda:

1. [EIP 186: Reduce ETH issuance before proof-of-stake](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/186).
[Carbonvote link](http://www.carbonvote.com/?p1=1).
[Reddit thread #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5lb684/eip186_to_decrease_eth_issuance_by_3x/).
[Reddit thread #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/60c2my/carbonvote_set_up_for_eip186/).
2. About EIP86 (a.k.a EIP-208), there is a difference between the EIP pull-request and the implementations. Which should be fixed?
3. Metropolis updates - specifically an update on where each client is at in implementation and an update on the tests. Some accepted EIPs are not yet specific enough to form a protocol consensus. What is the next action by whom?
