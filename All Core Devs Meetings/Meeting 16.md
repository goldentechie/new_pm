3. [[1:09:03](https://youtu.be/brhanl8T2UY?t=4143)] [Time permitting] "If we have time (no high priority), I would like to get some feedback about adding functionality that allows dapps to be notified whenever a certain address was touched by a transaction (including internal calls). This information does not necessarily have to be part of the block, but could be an isolated index database." [Christian R.]

# Notes
## 1.  [ERC-20 Token Standard Finalization](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/610) [Fabian, Nick, or Hudson]
Everyone in the call was uin agreement that [`throw` was a better solution than `return false;`](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-300260935) on failed transactions, but it is better that this issue is decided in the EIPs itself as this is an ERC.

## 2. Metropolis updates/EIPs.
